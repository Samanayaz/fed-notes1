    <h1>Think while Shopping </h1>
    <div>
    <p>
         Everyone loves a good deal and many people rarely buy anything full price. But with that comes the addiction to the sale. You end up coming up with great buys, but things you don’t really need. Have you ever you heard “It’s a steal! It’s on sale, you should buy it!” coming out of your head whenever you find a sign of 60% off in large letttering outside your favorite store. Sometimes you can actually score big, and other times you spend your whole budget on sale pieces you never get to use. I would like to put together some suggestions for shopping sales and how to get a great deal.

        <h4>Would you buy</h4>
        <p>
            Were you eyeing it before it went on sale? If so, it’s probably a good idea to snag it now when it’s actually is marked down. If it’s something you are buying just because its really cheap, but you wouldn’t have bought it full price, then leave it out of your cart. If you’re on the fence, go ahead and say no. I always tell people if you don’t LOVE it, don’t buy it. There are way too many things out there to just be “so-so” with purchases.

        <h4>Does it fit perfect?</h4>
        <p>
                Don’t sacrifice fit for the sale tag. I can’t tell you how many times I bought something too big or too small just because it was on sale and it never fit comfortably so I never wore it. Shoes, tops, jeans. ALL of it. Don’t sacrifice comfort. Save your money and buy the jeans that give you the apple bottom and the shoes that won’t slide.

        <h4> Will it take you into seasons to come?</h4>
        <p>
                Most of the time, things get marked down because they are about to bring out new items and seasonal clothing. Is what you’re about to purchase going to be in style next winter or is it a trend that won’t likely be around again. Staples, basics, and timeless pieces are always a good bet, but leave the trendy pieces and “out there” looks on the rack.

        <h4>Do you really like it?</h4>
        <p>
                I know so-and-so blogger might say you “need” it, or your best friend has it in black already, but if it’s not you or doesn’t fit your lifestyle, it isn’t even worth the sale price. Follow your gut and your go-to’s. Sometimes it is good to break outside the box when it comes to fashion, but overall, you know if you are truly going to wear it or not.

                You know the pieces you love, but aren’t willing to splurge on. When those go on sale, absolutely go for it. There are some high dollar items that I have my eye on, and I usually wait for them to go on sale before I pull the trigger. Almost everyone has sales. Know the store and what they usually offer, and be ready when they mark your item down.
